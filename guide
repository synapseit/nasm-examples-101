jump: jump to a memory address (via a label):

jmp label_name



compare: compare a register with another register or with a value

cmp rax, 1
cmp rax, rdi

as a result, the ZF flag is set to 1 if the comparison succeded (e.g. if rax=1 in our first example), or to 0 if it failed (rax <> 1)
since the ZF flag is set, we can have conditional jumps, following the comparison.
for example, we can compare rax with 1 and jump to the memory address identified by the label "_doThis" if the value of rax was in fact 1. if it wasn't, we will jump to the memory address identified by the label "_doThat":

cmp rax, 1
je _doThis
jne _doThat



pointers: i.e. how to use registers as a pointer to specific memory addresses. 

consider the following example, where we move the value of the rbx register in the rax register

mov rax, rbx 

contrast this with this other example, where we move the value that the rbx register is pointing to into the rax register

mov rax, [rbx]
